The Monty Hall Problem is a mathematical puzzle based on the American TV game show called "Let's Make a Deal", and is named after the show's host Monty Hall. 

In the game show, the contestant is presented with 3 doors, one of which contains a prize car while the other two contains a goat. The contestant will choose one door,
after which the host, who knows what's behind each door, will open another door that isn't the contestant's chosen door, and doesn't have the prize car behind it.
The host then presents the contestant with one choice: to switch the doors, or stick with the original door. 

The puzzle is whether the contestant would have a better chance at winning by switching or not. Marilyn Vos Savant, in the "Ask Marilyn" column of the Parade  magazine,
answers that switching will give you a 2/3 probability of winning as opposed to sticking with the original door, which will give you a 1/3 chance of winning.

Her response caused an outrage among the readers, many among which refused to believe that switching would lead to an actual better chance. As such, I want to tackle
the same problem but instead of a mathematical approach, I want to use coding to make a simulation of the game and see the results over a considerable sample size.
